# Getting basic information

The `swarm info` command is available to access some very basic information on your current status and settings.

## Syntax

Simply run

    $ swarm info

Here is an example output:

    Cluster status:      reachable
    Logged in as user:   someuser
    Current environment: acmecorp/dev

What does this information tell you?

* __Cluster status__: This is the general platform health and should say `reachable`.
* __Logged in as user__: Here you find the username you are currently logged in with.
* __Current environment__: The currently selected environment you are working in.
