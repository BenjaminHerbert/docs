# Welcome to Giant Swarms documentation

Giant Swarm enables you to easily develop, deploy, and host your micro-serviced applications. We leverage several technologies like Docker and CoreOS and bring them together to provide a simple yet powerful infrastructure. Besides Docker and your application stack there is not much you need to know in order to get started.
