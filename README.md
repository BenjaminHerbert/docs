# docs - User documentation for Giant Swarm

Simple markdown based documentation based on [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). Setup inspired by [Docker docs](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/tree/master/docs).

## How to document

Currently we have 3 sections:
  * Welcome: for a general introduction
  * Installation: on how to get started
  * Guides: howto types for typical user scenarios
  * Reference: detailed description of options / commands etc.

Currently there is only one master version.
