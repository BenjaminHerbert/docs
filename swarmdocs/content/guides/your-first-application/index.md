# Your first application — in your language

This tutorial guides you through the creation of an application using two interlinked components and a custom Docker image. The core is a NodeJS server (however you don't need any knowledge of NodeJS, let alone install anything NodeJS-specific). A Redis server is used as a temporary data store and we connect to an external API.
