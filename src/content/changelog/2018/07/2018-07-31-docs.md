# Documentation changes

- The documentation source has been moved to the GitHub repository [giantswarm/docs](https://github.com/giantswarm/docs/). With this, the entire documentation site's source is now public.

- Links from the [gsctl reference](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/) to the API documentation have been added where relevant.
