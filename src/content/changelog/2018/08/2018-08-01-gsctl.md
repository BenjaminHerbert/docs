# gsctl v0.12.0

## Under the hood

This release focuses on a major change in the client library used to communicate with the Giant Swarm API. As one effect, all uses of v1 API endpoints have been eliminated. All API communication now uses v4 endpoints.

## Minor changes

- When listing key pairs with `gsctl list keypairs`, key pairs that expire within the next 24 hours are highlighted in yellow. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/274)
- In `create kubeconfig` and `create keypair`, the handling of high TTL values has been improved. Note: For security reasons, we do not recommend creating key pairs with a TTL of several months or years. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/275).
- The output of the `gsctl ping` command has changed slightly to avoid fractions of milliseconds. (https://github.com/giantswarm/gsctl/pull/277)
